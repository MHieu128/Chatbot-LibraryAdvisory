## Installation

1. Clone or download the project
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up Azure OpenAI credentials (see Configuration section)

## Configuration

### Azure OpenAI Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your Azure OpenAI credentials in `.env`:
   ```env
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4
   OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
   OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
   DEBUG=false
   ```

3. To get these values:
   - **Endpoint**: From your Azure OpenAI resource in Azure Portal
   - **API Key**: From Keys and Endpoint section in Azure Portal
   - **Deployment Name**: The name you gave your model deployment
   - **Model**: The model you deployed (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-35-turbo)

### Running Without AI

The system can run in basic mode without Azure OpenAI if credentials are not configured. You'll still get structured analysis but without AI-enhanced insights.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run the chatbot
python library_advisory_bot.py

# Run with debug mode
python library_advisory_bot.py --debug

# Show version
python library_advisory_bot.py --version
```

### Interactive Commands

Once the chatbot is running, you can use these commands:

- `help` - Show detailed help information
- `list` - Display available libraries in database
- `analyze <library>` - Perform detailed analysis of a specific library
- `compare <lib1> vs <lib2>` - Compare two libraries side by side
- `recommend <category>` - Get recommendations for a specific category
- `ai <your question>` - Ask AI for intelligent analysis (requires Azure OpenAI)
- `save` - Save current conversation to markdown file
- `exit` or `quit` - Exit the chatbot (offers to save conversation)

### Example Queries

```
ü§ñ Library Advisor: analyze React
ü§ñ Library Advisor: compare React vs Vue.js
ü§ñ Library Advisor: recommend JavaScript frameworks
ü§ñ Library Advisor: what is Django?

```

## Function Calling Features

The system now includes advanced function calling capabilities that provide real-time package information:

### Supported Registries

- **NuGet (.NET packages)**: Real-time version information, download statistics, licensing, and metadata
- **npm (JavaScript/Node.js packages)**: Current versions, weekly downloads, repository links, and package details

### Automatic Registry Integration

When you ask about packages, the AI automatically:
1. **Checks Package Registries**: Fetches current version and download statistics
2. **Validates Existence**: Confirms packages exist and are actively maintained
3. **Extracts Metadata**: Gets licensing, authorship, and repository information
4. **Includes in Analysis**: Incorporates real-time data into recommendations

### Function Calling Demo

Run the included demonstration script:
```bash
python examples/function_calling_demo.py
```

This will show:
- NuGet package checking (e.g., Newtonsoft.Json)
- npm package checking (e.g., Express)
- Error handling for non-existent packages
- AI-enhanced analysis with live registry data

## Report Generation

The system automatically generates comprehensive markdown reports of your analysis sessions:

- **Automatic Timestamping**: Each report is saved with a timestamp for easy organization
- **Complete Analysis**: Includes all queries, responses, and AI insights
- **Clean Formatting**: Color codes are removed and content is properly formatted for markdown
- **Session Summaries**: Provides statistics about your analysis session
- **Export on Exit**: Option to save conversation when exiting the application

Reports are saved in the `reports/` directory with filenames like `library_analysis_20250726_143022.md`.

## AI-Enhanced Features

## Extending the System

### Adding New Libraries

The system automatically saves and loads a JSON database. You can extend it by:

1. Adding entries to the `library_database.json` file
2. Following the existing schema:

```json
{
  "library_key": {
    "name": "Library Name",
    "category": "Category",
    "language": "Programming Language",
    "description": "Brief description",
    "license": "License Type",
    "popularity": "High/Medium/Low",
    "alternatives": ["Alt1", "Alt2", "Alt3"]
  }
}
```

### Customizing Analysis

Modify the analysis methods in the `LibraryAdvisoryBot` class:

- `_get_advantages()` - Customize advantage analysis
- `_get_disadvantages()` - Customize disadvantage analysis
- `_get_cost_analysis()` - Modify cost evaluation logic
- `_get_risk_assessment()` - Adjust risk analysis criteria

## Advanced Features

### Command Line Arguments

```bash
python library_advisory_bot.py --help
python library_advisory_bot.py --version
python library_advisory_bot.py --debug
```

### Conversation History

The system maintains conversation history during the session for context-aware responses.

### Color-Coded Output

- üîç **Blue**: System messages and headers
- ‚úÖ **Green**: Positive information and advantages
- ‚ùå **Red**: Warnings, disadvantages, and risks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Important notes and cautions
- üí° **Cyan**: Helpful tips and recommendations

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Analysis**: Use `analyze <library>` to understand individual libraries
2. **Compare Alternatives**: Use `compare` to evaluate options side by side
3. **Consider Context**: Provide specific requirements for better recommendations
4. **Verify Information**: Always verify current information and test in your environment
5. **Update Database**: Keep the library database current with latest information

## Limitations

- Analysis based on general knowledge and built-in database
- Real-time information requires external API integration (not included)
- Recommendations should be verified against current documentation
- Database needs manual updates for latest library information

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with GitHub API for real-time data
- NPM/PyPI/Maven repository integration
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarking integration
- Machine learning-based recommendations
- Web interface version
- Plugin system for custom analyzers
